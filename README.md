# Capstone: Restaurant Reservation System

>You are a full stack app developer at Periodic Tables, a startup that is creating a reservation system for fine dining restaurants. The software is used only by restaurant personnel when a customer calls to request a reservation. At this point, the customers will not access the system online.

Live Site: https://restaurant-res-client-tw.herokuapp.com/dashboard (Must redeploy through netlify as Heroku has eliminated their free plan).

## Existing files

This repository is set up as a monorepo, meaning that the frontend and backend projects are in one repository. This allows you to open both projects in the same editor.

As you work through the user stories listed later in this document, you will be writing code that allows your frontend and backend applications to talk to each other. You will also write code to allow your controllers and services to connect to, and query, your PostgreSQL database via Knex.

The table below describes the folders in this starter repository:


| Folder/filepath | Description |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| ./back-end | The backend project, which runs on 'localhost:5001' by default. |
| ./front-end | The frontend project, which runs on 'localhost:3000' by default. |
